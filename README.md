# Lore Friendly QOL changes by SalJam

## I have uploaded both pak files for manually adding to the game and EXMODZ files for Jimk72's ModManager.

===========================================================================

I have tried to add QOL changes to the game to reduce the grind, but also keep within the lore and not make us OP

## AI_Adjustments

This is my first version of trying to alter the interactions between the various animal groups.
I have tested this mod over a few missions and have observed the following:
- Wolfs attacking and eating baby deer and rabbits etc
- Bears chasing and attacking deer and chamois etc
- Snow wolfs chasing snoa rabbits (less variety in the Snow biome)
- Curent version includes parents attacking small predators

I havent played a mission that is mainly based in the desert yet, but these behaviours should work there also.
